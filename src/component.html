            <h3 class="rule-title">1. Respectful behaviour</h3>
            <p class="rule-description">One of the most important rules outlining the rules and
                policies of the chess club is the requirement for respectful behaviour. Members are
                expected
                to
                treat each other with kindness and respect and to refrain from any form of bullying or
                harassment.
                This policy helps to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where all members can
                feel
                comfortable and safe.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 class="rule-title">2. Being there is essential</h3>
            <p class="rule-description">All members are expected to follow the guidelines set out by the
                club's organizers. This includes adhering to the schedule of meetings, participating in
                events and activities, and following the instructions of the coaches and mentors.
                Members
                who repeatedly fail to follow the guidelines may face disciplinary action, including
                suspension or expulsion from the club.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 class="rule-title">3. Conflicts are resolved in civilised terms</h3>
            <p class="rule-description">Members should be encouraged to communicate any issues or
                concerns they have with each other directly and respectfully. If the issue cannot be
                resolved through direct communication, members can approach a coach or mentor who can
                act as
                a mediator. If the issue still cannot be resolved, the matter can be escalated to a
                higher
                authority, such as the club president or board of directors. In cases of serious
                misconduct
                or violation of the club's rules and policies, disciplinary action may be taken,
                including
                suspension or expulsion from the club</p>
